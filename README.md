### **Colours**

<br>

The colour scheme for this project was created in [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and the inspiration was drawn from the iconic Poke Ball.

- #C1121F (Poke Ball Red): This vibrant red colour is instantly recognisable as the primary colour of a Poke Ball. It conveys energy, excitement, and passion.

- #FFFFFF (Poke Ball White): This clean and neutral white colour is instantly recognisable as the secondary colour of a Poke Ball. It complements the vibrant red, creating a visually appealing contrast. White is often associated with cleanliness and can enhance the overall readability of text and other elements on the website.

- #003049 (Dark Blue): This dark blue colour adds depth and sophistication to the colour palette. It contrasts well with both red and white, creating a balanced and visually pleasing combination.

Together, these colours not only capture the essence of Pokemon with the Poke Ball reference but also create a sleek and visually appealing aesthetic. The colour palette is likely to evoke a sense of nostalgia for Pokemon fans, especially with the subtle nod to the video game colours. Additionally, the combination of red, white, and dark blue creates a harmonious blend that can contribute to a polished and engaging user experience on the PokeMerchMania website.

## **DEPLOYMENT**

### **Version Control**

PokeMerchMania was created using [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- `git status` command was used to display the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged in the working directory and staging area.

- `git add .` command was used to stage all changes in the working directory and its subdirectories for the next commit.

- `git commit -m “commit message”` command was used to create a new commit in the Git repository with a specified commit message.

- `git push` command was used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

<br>

### **Heroku Deployment**

**Requirement and Procfile**

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` command was used to create a `requirements.txt` file.
- A new file named `Procfile` was created and a line of code `web: gunicorn poke_merch_mania.wsgi:application` was added.
- Then everything was pushed to the repository.

**Creating the Heroku App**

- Navigate to the Dashboard after logging into [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Select **"New"** and then **"Create new app".**
- Name the app and then select the closest region.
- Click **"Create app"** to confirm.

**Creating the Database**

- Navigate to the Dashboard after logging into [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
- Select **"Create New Instance".**
- Choose the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan and **Name** it, leaving the **Tags** section blank.
- Click **"Select Region"** and select the closest data center.
- Click **"Review".**
- If all details are correct, select **"Create instance".**
- Return to the Dashboard and click on the **database instance name** of the project.
- In the URL section, copy the database URL.
- Ensure that Django and Gunicorn are installed in your workspace by executing the command `pip3 install Django==3.0.1` and `pip3 install gunicorn==21.2.0`.
- Similarly, confirm the installation of the database infrastructure by running `pip3 install dj-database-url==0.5.0` and `pip3 install psycopg2==2.9.9`
- Then `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command was used to update the requirements.txt file.

**The env.py file**

- A `env.py` file must be present in the working directory and included in the `.gitignore` file.
- At the top of the `env.py` file, add the line of code `import os`.
- Below that add the following lines:

  `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "copied URL from ElephantSQL database"` <br>
  `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "create a secret key of your own or use a random key generator"` <br>

- Import the environment variables into the `settings.py` file.
- Then run `python3 manage.py migrate` in the terminal window to migrate the data structure to the database instance.

**Heroku Config Vars**

- Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard and select the **"Settings"** tab in the app that was just created.
- Click **"Reveal Config Vars"**.
- Add the following: <br>

  `DATABASE_URL` - `copied database URL from ElephantSQL` <br>
  `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` - `1` <br>
  `SECRET_KEY` - `copied secret key` <br>

**Connecting to GitHub and Deploy**

- Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard and select the **"Deploy"** tab in the app that was just created.
- Choose GitHub as the preferred deployment method.
- Locate the project repository by name and click **"Connect"** to establish the connection.
- Select **"Enable Automatic Deploys"** if desired.
- Lastly, select **"Deploy Branch"** to initiate the deployment process and observe the app being built.
